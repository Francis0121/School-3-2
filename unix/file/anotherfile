Around the fifth century A.D, tribes or people known as the Angles,Saxons, and Jutes traveled west from Germany and Denmark across the North Sea.
they settled in Britain, and by the late seventh century, they were speaking an early form of English.
In the late eighth century, the Vikings attacked England.
Fighting continued for almost two hundred tears.
During this time, many Latin, Danish,and Nors words entered the English language.
Latin gave English words like kitchen and cup.
From Danish and Norse, English borrowed skin, leg, and the pronouns them, Their, and they.
Many synonyms from the Norse language became integrated into English, for example, wrath (English), anger (Norse); shick (English), ill (Norse).
